        "description":"True to the origins of its name, Chamomile has gentle notes of apple, and there is a mellow, honey-like sweetness in the cup. It has a silky mouthfeel and yet remains a clean, delicately floral herbal tea, and even from the very first sip it feels wonderfully soothing. Chamomile is renowned for its sleep-inducing properties, which have led to its nickname: sleepy-time tea. It’s a natural sedative and muscle relaxant, meaning it’s the perfect cup to drink in bed to prepare for a refreshing night’s sleep.However, Chamomile tea is well-loved for many other health benefits too. It’s believed to soothe indigestion and period pain due to its muscle-relaxing properties, as well as being a natural way to boost the immune system and relieve symptoms of anxiety, making it far more than just a sleep aid.",
